# More data than we know what to do with! [Note: Women's results not available.]

This repository contains slides for an invited talk I delivered for the 2022 Workshop Organised by the Monash Business Analytics Team (WOMBAT). Abstract:

> Today, for many mainstream elite and professional sports, in-depth data is available for coaches, analysts, journalists, and fans to interrogate and understand "how the game is played". But for women's sports, substantial inequities remain in terms of data availability, depth, and accuracy. In this talk, I will discuss why it matters that detailed performance data is collected in women's sports and highlight some of the people and projects that are helping to close these data gaps.
